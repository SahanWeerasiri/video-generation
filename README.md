# Video Generation

This repository contains the video generation project, which involves multiple languages and tools, including Python, C++, Dart, and CMake.

## Overview

The project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for video generation. It includes various components such as a Flutter-based UI, a backend for processing, and multiple scripts for video generation and manipulation.

## Project Structure

- **Python**: Contains scripts and tools for video generation.
- **C++**: Includes performance-critical components.
- **Dart**: Used for the Flutter-based UI.
- **CMake**: Used for building C++ components.
- **Swift and C**: Additional components for specific functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
